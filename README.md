Practice of MySQL queries

In this repository I want to show you the "first baby files" of my MySQL queries.  
[01_hr_db_creation.sql](01_hr_db_creation.sql): creating the database.  
[02_hr_db_table_creations_and_data_inserts.sql](02_hr_db_table_creations_and_data_inserts.sql): create the tables.  
  
[basic_select.sql](Basic select/basic_select.sql): using simple "one-line" SQL commands to query data from tables.   
[aggregate_functions.sql](Aggregate functions/aggregate_functions.sql): using in every task GROUP BY command to aggregate data from tables.  
[joins.sql](Joins/joins.sql): using JOIN command in most of task. This command can useful to aggregate data from different tables.  
[restricting_and_sorting.sql](Restricting and sorting/restricting_and_sorting.sql): using WHERE command in every task. This command ensures to select any kind of information from tables.   
[string_functions.sql](String functions/string_functions.sql): using commands what can modify or choose SUBSTRINGs of the tables.  
[subqueries.sql](Subqueries/subqueries.sql): using many-many WHERE and SELECT command in every task.  
  
Here is the UML of this database:
